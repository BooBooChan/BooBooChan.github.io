	<h1>Bridget's Favorite Animal Type</h1>
	<p>The hummingbird is one of my favorite animals since I learned about them in third grade. Hummingbirds are small, colorful birds, and are the only species of bird able to hover in midair with their wings (as opposed to birds that accidently hover by stupidly flying against the wind current). They fly incredibly fast, such that spotting them feels like spotting a shooting star.</p> <br>

	<p>Their diet is also pretty unique. They don't eat solid foods like seeds or dead carcuses. They prefer flower nectar, or at least some kind of sugar-laden liquid. By hovering in front of a flower, they are able to drink the nectar with their small, almost syringe-like beaks.</p>" alt="hummingbird feeding off a flower">
